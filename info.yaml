# Tiny Tapeout project information
project:
  title:        "ALU_8bits"      # Project title
  author:       "Job Anleu"      # Your name
  discord:      ""               # Your discord username, for communication and automatically assigning you a Tapeout role (optional)
  description:  "ALU de 8 bits con 6 operaciones autom√°ticas cada 1 segundo. Entradas A y B completas." # One line description of what your project does
  language:     "Verilog"        # other examples include SystemVerilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc
  clock_hz:     100000000        # Clock frequency in Hz (or 0 if not applicable)

  # How many tiles your design occupies? A single tile is about 167x108 uM.
  tiles: "1x1"                   # Valid values: 1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 3x2, 4x2, 6x2 or 8x2

  # Your top module name must start with "tt_um_". Make it unique by including your github username:
  top_module:  "tt_um_job"

  # List your project's source files here.
  # Source files must be in ./src and you must list each source file separately, one per line.
  # Don't forget to also update `PROJECT_SOURCES` in test/Makefile.
  source_files:
    - "tt_um_job.v"
    - "suma.v"
    - "resta.v"
    - "and_alu.v"
    - "or_alu.v"
    - "shiftleft.v"
    - "shiftright.v"

# The pinout of your project. Leave unused pins blank. DO NOT delete or add any pins.
# The output pins, labeled R[7:0], display the result of the operation performed between the input operands A[7:0] and B[7:0]. Since the ALU cycles through 6 automatic operations, a new result is shown on R every second.
